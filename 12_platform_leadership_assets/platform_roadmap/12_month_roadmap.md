# 12-Month Data Platform Roadmap

## Q1: Stabilize & Standardize

- Audit existing pipelines, SLAs, and incidents.
- Implement or strengthen data quality framework (e.g., Great Expectations, dbt tests).
- Define and roll out platform standards (coding, modeling, testing, orchestration).
- Stand up basic observability for key pipelines (logs, metrics, alerts).

## Q2: Modernize & Consolidate

- Migrate critical pipelines from legacy systems to modern stack (e.g., Spark, dbt).
- Consolidate overlapping data models and reduce duplication.
- Introduce CI/CD for data pipelines and models.
- Establish data contracts for 3–5 critical domains.

## Q3: Scale & Optimize

- Optimize performance and cost (partitioning, caching, clustering, auto-scaling).
- Expand observability to include SLOs and business-facing reliability metrics.
- Introduce self-service patterns for analytics teams (semantic layer, curated marts).
- Pilot AI/LLM-enabled features (e.g., documentation Q&A, metric explanations).

## Q4: Govern & Empower

- Formalize data governance council and domain ownership.
- Roll out AI/LLM governance policies and patterns.
- Expand platform training and onboarding for new teams.
- Review and refresh roadmap for the next 12 months based on learnings.
