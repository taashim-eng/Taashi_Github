# Platform Standards

This document captures the **standards and conventions** I set and enforce as a
Data Engineering Manager / Director. The goal is to:

- Enable teams to move fast **without** breaking quality or alignment.
- Make code and pipelines **predictable** across domains.
- Provide a shared language for engineers, analysts, and stakeholders.
