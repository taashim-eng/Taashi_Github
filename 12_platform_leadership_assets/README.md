# 12. Platform Leadership Assets

This folder collects **manager/director-level artifacts** that complement the
hands-on engineering work in the rest of this GitHub. It is designed to show
how I think as a **Data Engineering Manager / Director** about:

- Standards and patterns across teams
- Onboarding and scaling engineering talent
- Roadmapping platform evolution
- Defining and tracking the right metrics

## Structure

- `platform_standards/`  
  Coding standards, data modeling standards, testing practices, orchestration patterns,
  and CI/CD conventions for a modern data platform.

- `team_onboarding/`  
  A structured onboarding guide and a small script to generate personalized onboarding
  checklists for new engineers.

- `platform_roadmap/`  
  A 12-month high-level roadmap capturing technical, organizational, and governance
  milestones for a data platform.

- `platform_metrics/`  
  A definition of key platform and team metrics, plus a small utility script that
  simulates and aggregates metrics for reporting.

These artifacts are intentionally narrative and operational, reflecting how I lead
teams and platforms, not just how I write code.
