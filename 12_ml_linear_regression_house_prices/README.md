# Linear Regression — Predicting House Prices

## Overview
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end **linear regression workflow** using scikit-learn.
The goal is to predict house prices based on:

- Square footage
- Number of bedrooms
- Neighborhood quality score

This mirrors real-world pricing models used in real estate, lending, and investment analytics.

## What This Project Demonstrates
- Synthetic dataset creation
- Feature engineering
- Train/test split
- Model training using LinearRegression
- Model evaluation (MAE, RMSE, R²)
- Visualization of predictions vs. actual values
- Extensive commentary for readability

## How to Run
```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
python src/linear_regression_house_prices.py
```
